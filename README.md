# Calculator App

## Problem Statement
Create a simple calculator app to perform basic mathematical operations with a user friendly interface

## Technology Used
- **React.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Math.js** for expression evaluation

## Assumptions
1. The calculator only supports standard mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and toggling positive/negative signs.
2. Inputs are limited to numerical values and mathematical operators.
3. Division by zero gracefully displays "Undefined" as the result.

## Limitations
1. The app does not support advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root).
2. It is optimised for basic usage and may not handle edge cases involving complex input sequences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have both installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).
### Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:conorhutchins/calculator-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd calculator-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
    - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) (or the port shown in the terminal).

### Testing the Application
**Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
